## Backend

The backend of the Web Piano application is built using Flask. It provides the following endpoints:

- `POST /api/upload`: Upload a new recording.
- `GET /api/recordings`: List all available recordings.
- `GET /uploads/<filename>`: Access a specific uploaded recording.
- `GET /recordings`: View the recordings page.
- `GET /`: View the main application page.

### File Management

The backend manages file storage by ensuring the total size of the upload folder does not exceed a specified limit. If the limit is exceeded, the oldest file is deleted to make space for new uploads.

### Configuration

- `UPLOAD_FOLDER`: The directory where uploaded files are stored.
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE`: The maximum size of an individual file (1MB).
- `MAX_FOLDER_SIZE`: The maximum total size of the upload folder (1GB).
